# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks.

Each experiment is contained in a subdirectory.

If the experiment uses a different set of packages to the main `power_perceiver` then the subdirectory will include an `environment.yml` file.

The subdirectory's README.md might also include links to GitHub issues and/or Google docs with more notes.
